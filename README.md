# 🩺 Skin Disorder Prediction

Predicting different types of skin disorders using machine learning models trained on dermatological datasets.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Skin disorders are common health issues and can be caused by genetic, environmental, or lifestyle factors.  
Accurate prediction and classification of skin conditions can help in **early diagnosis** and **treatment planning**.

This project applies **data science and machine learning** to:

- Analyze dermatology datasets  
- Identify key features influencing diagnosis  
- Build predictive models for classifying skin disorders  

**Goal:** Assist healthcare professionals with decision support systems for improved dermatological care.
